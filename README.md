# Data Analysis using Power BI on Road Accident Dataset
As part of a data analytics project, tasked with creating a comprehensive dashboard for the road accident dataset for the years 2021 and 2022. The objective is to analyze total casualties for each year, year-on-year growth, casualties by accident severity, vehicle type, location, and time of day (day or night). The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize the data using Power BI to enable data-driven decisions and provide insights to stakeholders.

The task involves cleaning and analyzing the road accident dataset for the specified years and creating visualizations to represent key metrics. This includes identifying trends in total casualties, year-on-year growth rates, distribution of casualties by accident severity, vehicle type involved in accidents, accident locations, and time of day when accidents occur

Extracted and cleaned the road accident dataset for the years 2021 and 2022. Calculated total casualties for each year and analyzed year-on-year growth. Segmented casualties based on accident severity, vehicle type, location, and time of day. Utilized Power BI to create interactive visualizations, including line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts, to represent the analyzed data. Implemented filters and slicers in the dashboard to allow stakeholders to interactively explore the data and gain insights.

The analysis revealed a decrease in total casualties from the previous year, indicating potential improvements in road safety measures. Furthermore, the data highlighted that a higher number of accidents occur during dry weather conditions and on fine road surfaces. Additionally, there was a higher prevalence of car accidents compared to other vehicle types. Overall, the dashboard provides valuable insights for stakeholders to make informed decisions and prioritize interventions to enhance road safety.
